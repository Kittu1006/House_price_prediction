# House_price_prediction
Summary: 
 In this, I collected the USA Housing dataset from Kaggle and the divided the dataset into training dataset and testing dataset. Then applied ML algorithm and trained machine through training dataset and finally calculated the machine score using testing dataset and predicted prices using random values.   
 
Requirements:   
•	Jupyter Notebook  
•	Pandas – Dataset  
•	Matplotlib for Visualisation  
•	Scikit Learn for Creating and Validating Models   
  
Algorithm:  
1.	Importing the libraries and Loading the dataset from a csv file  
2.	Exploratory data analysis  
3.	Spitting into Train – test data  
4.	Creating models and Training them  
5.	Performance metrics evaluation for the classification
